# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive course on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**, where you'll learn to build intelligent, embodied systems that bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and physical robots.

## Course Structure

This course is organized into four comprehensive modules:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module-1-ros2/nodes-topics-services)
Learn how ROS 2 serves as the middleware enabling communication, control, and embodiment of humanoid robots. Understand nodes, topics, services, and how to create Python agents for ROS control.

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/docs/module-2-digital-twin/physics-simulation-gazebo)
Explore physics-based simulation and virtual environments for humanoid robots. Master Gazebo for physics simulation, Unity for high-fidelity visualization, and simulated sensors that mirror real hardware.

### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)](/docs/module-3-isaac/isaac-sim-synthetic-data)
Dive into high-performance AI perception, navigation, and training for humanoid robots. Learn about Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS for accelerated perception and VSLAM, and Nav2 for humanoid path planning.

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Capstone](/docs/module-4-vla/speech-recognition)
Connect perception, language, and action in humanoid robots with Vision-Language-Action systems. Implement voice-to-action with speech recognition, LLM-based cognitive planning, and build your autonomous humanoid.

## Getting Started

Begin your journey into physical AI and humanoid robotics by exploring Module 1, where you'll establish the foundational ROS 2 communication infrastructure that will be essential for all subsequent modules.
