# Speech Recognition for VLA Systems

## Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand voice-activated (VLA) command systems for humanoid robots
- Learn how to implement speech recognition for robotics applications
- Explore natural language processing for robot command interpretation
- Practice integrating speech recognition with robot control systems

## Introduction to Voice-Activated Robotics

Voice-activated systems (VLA) enable natural human-robot interaction through spoken commands. For humanoid robots, speech recognition is a key component of social interaction capabilities.

## Speech Recognition Technologies

Modern speech recognition systems use deep learning models to convert audio signals to text or directly to robot commands. These systems can be implemented with various approaches:

- Cloud-based services (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text)
- On-device processing for privacy and latency concerns
- Custom models trained on specific robotic command vocabularies

## Integrating Speech Recognition with Robot Control

VLA systems translate spoken commands into robot actions through natural language processing.

## Practical Exercise

Implement a simple speech recognition node in ROS 2 that translates spoken commands into robot movements.

## Summary

Speech recognition enables intuitive human-robot interaction in humanoid robotics systems, making them more accessible and user-friendly.

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, we'll explore multimodal interaction systems combining speech, vision, and gesture recognition for humanoid robots.
