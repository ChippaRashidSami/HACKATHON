# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

This repository contains a comprehensive course on AI-powered humanoid robotics, organized into four modules that progress from foundational concepts to advanced AI integration.

## Overview

The book is organized into four modules:

1. **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Foundational concepts for humanoid robot control
2. **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Physics-based simulation and virtual environments 
3. **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - High-performance AI perception, navigation, and training
4. **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Connecting perception, language, and action (Capstone)

## Learning Progression

The modules are designed to build upon each other:

1. Start with Module 1 to understand foundational ROS 2 concepts
2. Proceed to Module 2 to learn simulation techniques
3. Advance to Module 3 for AI perception and navigation
4. Complete with Module 4, the capstone that integrates all concepts

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic programming concepts
- Familiarity with robotics terminology
- Node.js version 18.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/physical-ai-humanoid-book.git
   cd physical-ai-humanoid-book
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

This will start the Docusaurus development server at `http://localhost:3000`.
